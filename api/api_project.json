The endpoints for registering and authenticating are defined below as well however in order for easire jump start of the API is the order of execution shown below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If not yet registered make a call to the /api/register endpoint. If you are unsure if you are registered or not may you skip to step 2, it will eventually give a descriptive error message stating that you are currently not registered then jump back to 1.</li>\n<li>Make a call to the /api/authenticate endpoint with your Facebook Graph OAuth Access Token and the corresponding user id. Please note that different &quot;Facebook Apps&quot; generate different user ids for the same user. This is important to keep in mind when using Facebooks Graph API Explorer in order to obtain a development token. The functionality will be fully functioning but one cannot expect their recipes added through the user interface to be shown as &quot;yours&quot;.</li>\n<li>The /api/authenticate endpoint returns a access token valid only for the API. This must be supplied in all the following calls to the API. This is done by placing the token in the x-access-token header field. If using Postman is this simply done by clicking the &quot;Headers&quot; tab and then adding a new row.</li>\n<li>Start using the API!</li>\n</ol>\n"
